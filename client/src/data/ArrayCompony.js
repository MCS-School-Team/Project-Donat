        WhyDonate:"Our work to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty takes a family from crisis through stabilization into self-directed journeys towards a brighter future. Recognized as a CNN Top 10 Hero in 2019, our founder and CEO, Najah Bazzy, is so dedicated to this mission that she takes no salary. In fact, Zaman has been recognized for stellar return on donor investment. For the last 5 years, independent auditors confirmed that over 90% of every dollar donated to Zaman goes to programming. Zaman innovates, pivots, and grows as community needs evolve, as evidenced by our handling of the pandemic, our expansion into apprenticeships and our upcoming wellness clinic construction. Whether you are looking to support poverty eradication, feed families, educate women, provide wellness support to those who can’t afford it, or fund workforce development opportunities, Zaman programs address these areas.

        Mission: "Game to Grow’s mission is three-fold: Provide gaming groups for therapeutic, educational, and community growth Train others to use game-based interventions to benefit their own communities Promote awareness of the life-enriching potential of games across the world Many of the people we support have autism, ADHD, anxiety, or depression which impacts how they experience the world and form relationships with others. Our model honors neurodiversity. It doesn’t assume a deficit that needs to be addressed – it supports our participants to flourish on their own terms. Game to Grow groups are a safe, supportive, and fun environment that helps improve social confidence, reduce isolation, and form friendships that last. ",
        WhyDonate:"Game to Grow is on the pioneering edge of innovative social support programs for neurodivergent youth, as we use both tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and video games like Minecraft to help youth become more confident, creative, and socially capable. As such, we align perfectly with cryptocurrencies as an outside-of-the-mainstream donation platform! "
